# Covid Information Site

## Working with API'S and Chart.js

https://covid-world-data.netlify.app/

In this project I build a site that collect data from a Corona API and show the data
different data in a graph using chart.js, 
The graph can show confirmed cases,critical,recovered and deaths in different regions of the world, and countries 
show information for each country in that region,


- I used an API that return the countries code (cca2) in a region of the world
- I used the countries code to fetch the information from the corona api.
- I used Chart.js to show the data
